# **NODE INSTALLATION**

Node is a server-side runtime environment for Javascript. It allows us to run Javascript code on the terminal.

**For Node.js 9:**

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```


**To compile and install native addons from npm you may also need to install build tools:**

```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```

**To install Node on MAC SYSTEMS follow the Instructions from this**

```

```

## **Confirm Installation**

```
npm -v 5.5.1
```

```
node -v v9.2.0
```

We run npm -v to check the version of Node Package Manager Installed. And node -v to check if Node is installed.

You should have node version higher than 9+ and npm 5+


## **To Install using Node Version Manager Which is preferable as it is always up-to date:**

I will also help with installation of git and other packages.
